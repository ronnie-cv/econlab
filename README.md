## Economics Research
This repository contains my personal code for economic research projects. I am a Research Assistant at the [UC San Diego Economics Research Lab](https://economics.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/resources/undergraduate-graduate-research-lab/index.html), supervised by PhD students. I joined the Lab in Fall 2024.
