## Economics Research Lab
This repository contains my personal code for economic research projects. I am a Research Assistant at the UC San Diego Economics Research Lab (the Lab), working under the mentorship of two different PhD students on separate projects. I started contributing in Fall 2024, and am also beginning work on my senior research project.
